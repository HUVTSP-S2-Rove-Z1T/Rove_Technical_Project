# Rove_Technical_Project


This is a tool that helps users identify the highest-value redemption options for loyalty points or miles. Using public data on airline award charts, travel pricing, and miles valuations (e.g., from sites like UpgradedPoints or The Points Guy), to create a basic algorithm to estimate value-per-mile for different redemption paths (e.g., economy flight vs. hotel booking vs. gift card). The tool will include a user-facing interface where someone can enter a destination, travel dates, and number of miles, and receive suggested redemptions ranked by estimated value. The tool may include data visualization or filtering features.
